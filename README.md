# PHP2550 Practical Data Analysis: Final Portfolio
This final portfolio includes three research projects for the course, PHP2550 Practical Data Analysis. 
* Each project folder includes a written report, reproducible code, and tables and figures related to the project.
* `Project 1` examines the effects of smoking during pregnancy (SPD) and Environmental Tobacco Smoking (ETS) on adolescent self-regulation, externalizing behavior, and substance use.
  * Mainly an Exploratory Analysis of parent and child data, including information on general demographics, smoking status, smoking during pregnancy, smoke exposures, substance use of child, self-regulation problems of child, and externalizing behaviors of child.
* `Project 2` derives models for predicting the need for Tracheostomy in Infants with severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.
  *  Applied the multiple imputation technique for imputing missing data
  *  Focused on model derivation and selection process. LASSO and Best Subset methods are performed to obtain robust prediction models. The model performances were evaluated using evaluation metrics for binary outcomes.
* `Project 3` examines the transportability of Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Models through a simulation study using the ADEMP framework.
  * Implemented Brier score calculation for transportability analysis. The Brier score estimator was also evaluated using bias and MSE.
  * Used the ADEMP simulation framework to simulate target data and assumed individual-level observations are not available. Data were simulated based on the summary statistics of target data.
